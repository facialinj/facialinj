		<description><![CDATA[Doc, Your reply is a little patronising. We all know it is not the actual flu. It is &#039;flu-like&#039; symptoms, which are a known and admitted side effect of botox. Muscle weakness, chills, headache, tiredness, fatigue, general body aches, stiff neck, sore throat, blocked sinuses etc. It FEELS like I have the flu. I don&#039;t actually think I have the flu. I know I don&#039;t. I have botox side effects. Read the side effects list from Allergan. It actually notes two of the side effects as &#039;flu-like symptoms&#039; and &#039;anxiety&#039;. Why would Allergan list them as side effects if it never happens? Would you like to have a try at answering my antibiotic question as some of the medical literature I have accessed links concurrent administration of tetracyclines and botox to DEATH by repiratory depression and fatal apnea.]]></description>
